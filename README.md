Example Microblogging Service

=Instructions=
The goal of this assignment is to develop a very simple prototype of a microblogging service in which users can write up to 140 character messages.  Users can subscribe to other users and see a list of recent messages from those they're subscribed to (this is probably starting to sound familiar.)  This being just a simple prototype, authentication is done via basic http auth, and the front-end should be a single html page where content is loaded dynamically via asynchronous javascript.  We've setup a very basic framework with a simple back-end API written in PHP, the javascript to easily interact with that API, a MySQL database with a users table already set up, and login logic to show how all the pieces fit together.
